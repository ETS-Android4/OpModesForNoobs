Hello! I am Sriram Kalki, a programmer from Team 6547 Cobalt Colts, located in Overland Park, Kansas. During
my rookie year (Freight Frenzy), I have stumbled upon many challenges while coding, from encoder/imu issues to
Robot Vision problems! If it weren't from alumentors, my coach and teammate, and the FTC Discord (psst
you should join it https://discord.gg/first-tech-challenge), I would have been so irritated and would have lost
a lot of motivation to pursue robotics. Because of this, I want to help new teams with programming so that they
don't struggle with coding!
